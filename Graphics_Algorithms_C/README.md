This code contains the implementations of some computer GRAPHICS ALGORITHMS.
It is written in C programming language and can be easly execute on turbo C compiler.but first you need to ON graphichs  mode in that.

The relevent thing is that the drawings of line / circle and all transformations and clipping are implemented maually using the specific algorithms for them not by the predefine utilities of C graphics.
 
The objective is go through the pixel based algorithms of computer graphichs in practical manner.

Programmed algorithms in this code are:
         DRAWING: 
                         1.  D.D.A. line drwaing
                         2. BRESENHEM line drawing
                         4. Generalized BRESENHEM line drawing
                         3. Mid Point circle drawing
   
        TRANSFORMATIONS: object is triangle
                          1.  TRANSITION of object
                          2. SCALLING  of object
                          3. ROTATION of object
                          4. REFLECTION  of object
                          5. SHEARING oof object :  rectangle
            
         CLIPPING of lines within window
                          1. COHEN CLIPPING ALGORITHM
